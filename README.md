## **Deliverables Overview**

### 1. **Grid Systems**
- Explored grid layouts in websites and apps.
- Deliverable: A Figma file with 4 examples of grid systems from various platforms.
- Details include:
  - Column arrangements.
  - Spacing (gutters and margins).
  - Content alignment.

---

### 2. **Multi-State Elements**
- Screenshots of 5 multi-state elements from various websites.
- Elements include buttons, menu titles, filters, and call-to-actions with hover or click interactions.
- **Figma File**: Organized screenshots with website names and interaction details.

---

### 3. **Accessibility in Websites**
- Identified 3 accessibility measures from websites.
- Examples include color contrast, enlarged hover text, and accessible link colors.
- **Figma File**: Showcases these elements, highlighting their role in easing reading or perception.

---

### 4. **Accessibility in Apps**
- Analyzed 3 accessibility measures in apps.
- Examples include dynamic resizing, high-contrast themes, and alternative text for images.
- **Figma File**: Screenshots of app elements with their accessibility features explained.

---
